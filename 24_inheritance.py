# Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?
# -->Inheritance relationship defines the classes that inherit from other classes as derived, subclass, or sub-type classes. Base class remains to be the source from which a subclass inherits. For example, you have a Base class of “Animal,” and a “Lion” is a Derived class. The inheritance will be Lion is an Animal.

# What is init?
# -->The init command is an executable shell script that terminates all active processes on a system and then synchronizes the disks before changing run levels.

# What Is A Constructor In Python?
# -->Constructors in Python is a special class method for creating and initializing an object instance at that class. In Python every class has a constructor; it's not required to define explicitly. The purpose of the constructor is to construct an object and assign a value to the object's members.
